<h1 style="font-size: 50px;text-align: center;color: purple">Home Cleaning</h1>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;line-height: 2;font-size: 20px">Spring has sprung, and it’s time to start your spring cleaning. That’s especially true if you have items around the house that can hurt your dog when you don’t get rid of them or replace them.
<br>
Even responsible dog owners have items that they should throw away for their pups’ safety.
<br>
It can be tough to keep up with replacing and repairing all the stuff that we need to take care of our dogs, but it’s important. Old, expired, or worn-out items can be a health hazard for your dog.
<br>
Here are ten things dog owners need to throw out right now.<br></p>
<br>

<div style="padding-left: 40px;padding-right: 40px">

 ">1. Plastic Bowls
</h1>

    margin-inline-start: 280px;
    margin-inline-end: 0px;
}">Plastic food and water bowls may be cheap and easy to use, but plastic is much more difficult to effectively
<br> clean than other materials, and chips and cracks can be a breeding ground for bacteria.
<br>
Plastic is easy to chew and chip, and if your dog is unsupervised for even a short time, the shards can be a choking hazard or cause internal bleeding.
<br>
Also, as the plastic begins to break down, it can leach into your pup’s food and water, and it’s full of harmful chemicals that can cause serious health problems.
<br>
Toss out the plastic bowls and stick with a safer material.
<br>

</p>
<div style="line-height: 2;font-size: 18px;margin-left: 40px;"> 
  Plastic dog food bowls come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. They tend to be inexpensive and unlikely to break if dropped. Many are dishwasher-safe. However, plastic bowls are generally not recommended for many dogs.
   Bowls made of plastic can be easily chewed or scratched by your dog, leaving places for bacteria to build up.
    Additionally, some dogs may develop an allergy to the plastic, resulting in a mild skin reaction on the chin or face. It's probably best to find a healthier option for your dog's meals.

}">Your dog may have a favorite toy, and that toy probably has ages worth of bacteria living inside of it. These bacteria can cause everything from diarrhea to gum disease.
<br>
Some toys can be microwaved or tossed in the laundry for a quick cleaning, but that doesn’t stop the toy from becoming a choking hazard as it ages and starts to fall apart.<br>
 Stuffing, stray threads, or tiny parts that fall off can all wreak havoc on the digestive system.
<br>
Dog toys are typically inexpensive, so try finding your pup a new favorite instead of keeping the old one around.
<br>

</p>
<div style="line-height: 2;font-size: 18px;margin-left: 40px;"> 
  Many factors contribute to the safety or danger of a toy, and a number of them depend upon your dog's size, activity level and preferences. Another thing to consider is the environment where your dog spends their time. Although we can't guarantee the safety of any specific toy, we can offer the following guidelines.
<br>
<br>
The things that are usually most attractive to dogs are often the very things that are the most dangerous. Dog-proof your home by removing string, ribbon, rubber bands, children's toys, pantyhose and other inedible items that could be swallowed.

}">Maybe your dog got sick one time and your vet gave you a prescription. After the condition cleared up, you figured you’d keep the medicine around in case you ever needed it again.
<br>
This may seem like a cautious move, but it’s not a good idea. Medicine expires and loses its effectiveness after some time. Also, your dog’s medical needs might not be the same as before.
<br>
Some owners might think that a medication for one pet can be used to treat another pet, but this is also a mistake. Different animals have diff needs.
<br>
Toss the old meds and go to the vet when your dog needs you to.
<br>
</p>
<div style="line-height: 2;font-size: 18px;margin-left: 40px;"> 
Often when people utilize old medications, they are doing so without guidance from a veterinarian. This can be dangerous if there are other factors, such as different medications or supplements being used, that make administration inappropriate. It is always best to seek our help before starting your pet on any medication.
<br><br>
If you wish to store your veterinary pharmaceuticals, it is essential that you adhere to storage guidelines. Some medications must be kept within a certain temperature range, while others might be light sensitive. Keeping lids sealed to prevent air exposure and moisture contamination is important, as well.

}">If you’re like me, you get Halloween treats for all the trick-or-treater dogs in the neighborhood who come to visit. Maybe you’ve got some special birthday treats or bones for the holidays.
<br>
Those are nice, but it’s best not to keep them around until next year. Check the expiration dates on the package and do not give your dog expired treats. Food that has gone past expiration loses nutrients, and the preservatives break down leaving the treats open to contamination, mold growth, and bacteria infestation.
<br>
Get some new treats once a year for special occasions, and if they aren’t finished, throw them out.

Oli’s early homemade dog birthday cakes were casserole dish dinners with a candle. Nothing flashy, but doggone delish and he knew it was something special. Although I enjoy making my crazy cakes and the excitement our boys get from cake time, it’s important to note that special celebrations don’t require anything fancy. Just lots of love and whatever makes you and your pet happiest.

}">If you groom your dog yourself, you may have scissors, sheers, nail clippers, and all sorts of grooming items that are getting worn down.
<br>
The problem with dull blades is that they tend to crush instead of cut. 
<br>hat can lead to tugging on your dog’s fur during the grooming process, and when it comes to clipping nails, crushing is very painful.
<br>
Grooming can already be a stressful thing for your dog, so don’t add pain on top of that. Replace any dull equipment.
<br>
</p>
<div style="line-height: 2;font-size: 18px;margin-left: 40px;"> 
&nbsp; Purchasing grooming tools can be a very difficult decision. 
<br>The type of tool you select depends on the coat type you will be grooming. 
<br>Choosing the incorrect tool for a dog’s coat type can have a detrimental impact on both your effectiveness and your speed as a groomer.

}">A new bed can take some getting used to. Most dogs like the smell of their old bed and find it comforting. But that doesn’t stop an old bed from falling apart.
<br>
Like old toys, tattered bedding can pose both a choking hazard and a problem to the digestive system if your dog chews on it. Threads, pieces of cloth, and stuffing can cause blockages and obstructions that may hurt your pup.
<br>
If your dog is having trouble adjusting to a new bed, use positive reinforcement and familiar scents to ease your pup into it
